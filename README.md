Assignment for week 2 of the Radium Rocket course:

PROBLEM: 

Find a new article and build a html document focusing on semantic elements and also sytle.  Make the HTML document including styling look identical to the original article. Do this also for the article in week 1.

In addition, add a link at the end of both articles linking each article too each other

Finally, create a README document with a link to the original articles as follows:

*** People you should Know: Matt Jenne ***

original article is at : https://comomag.com/2021/12/01/matt-jenne/

SOLUTION:

Using HTML and CSS I created the following articles:

Week 1 article: https://mjenne.github.io/touch-bistro/index-lt.html

Week 2 article: https://mjenne.github.io/touch-bistro/index.html

COMMENTS:

There is a section of code that has been changed to a comment as I could not get the element to behave the same as the original article
