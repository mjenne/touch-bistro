              <h3>Job description</h3>
              <p>A bit of everything, mostly supporting our great crew.</p>
              <h3>Hometown</h3>
              <p>Toronto, Canada.</p>
              <h3>Years lived in Columbia</h3>
              <p>30 or so.</p>
              <h3>Quote you live by</h3>
              <p><q>Keep moving forward</q> &#8722;Maj. Richard Winters, from Band of Brothers.</p>
              <h3>Favorite volunteer/community activity</h3>
              <p>
                Working with our economic development community through REDI in order to grow Columbia&#39;s 
                economy. I am also passionate about our airport and making our air service as good as it can be. 
                As a member of the Columbia Airport Advisory Board, I&#39;m excited to see us extend the main 
                runway so bigger planes can take off and land in all weather conditions, and I&#39;m excited to 
                see the completion of the new terminal, set to open next summer.
              </p>
              <h3>Favorite recent project</h3>
              <p>
                The Swift Prepared Foods facility project that the team at REDI worked to win for Columbia over 
                several competing cities. We worked with many different stakeholders to bring Swift&#39;s new operation 
                to town. It will be an Italian meat curing facility that will provide specialty meats to retailers 
                throughout the country. Swift will invest $200 million in the facility and create 250 new jobs in our 
                burgeoning food manufacturing corridor. 
              </p>
              <h3>A Columbia businessperson you admire and why</h3>
              <p>
                Brian Whorley. His integrity and entrepreneurial spirit are beacons for anyone that wants to start their 
                own business. A few years ago, Brian had an idea to make health care more accessible and affordable 
                while helping employees with deductibles and unexpected expenses. His company Paytient is a rising startup 
                that is receiving national attention. Throughout, Brian has remained humble and continues to work hard 
                to realize his vision.  
              </p>
              <h3>Why you are passionate about your job</h3>
              <p>
                Every day is different. I enjoy the variety and challenges that come with operating our small businesses. 
                I also enjoy the interactions that I have with my staff and our customers. The restaurant business gets 
                in your blood, and those that love it love the friends and family we make along the way.  
              </p>
              <h3>Why you are passionate about your company</h3>
              <p>
                My partners, Jeremy Brown and Adam Dushoff, and I have created three restaurants that, so far, are popular 
                and see our share of repeat business. We want to continue to provide great food, great service, and an 
                interesting atmosphere to delight our guests.
